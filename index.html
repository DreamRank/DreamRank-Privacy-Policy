      <p>DreamRank (“we”, “our”, “us” ) is a wellness app that helps you build healthy sleep habits through quests and social challenges. We respect your privacy and design our product with security and transparency in mind. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

      <h2>1) Key Points at a Glance</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We use Apple’s native frameworks: <strong>HealthKit</strong> (read-only) and <strong>CloudKit</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Health data is never used for advertising, sold, or shared with third parties</strong> for marketing purposes.</li>
        <li>Health data access is <strong>optional</strong> and requires your explicit permission in the Health app. You can revoke it anytime.</li>
        <li>Profile and challenge data (e.g., username, score, rooms/leaderboards) are stored in your <strong>iCloud</strong> via CloudKit.</li>
        <li>You may delete your account and CloudKit data from inside the app or by contacting us.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2) Data We Collect &amp; Why</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Health Data (via HealthKit – read only)</h3>
      <p>With your consent, we read specific data from Apple Health to power app features and insights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Sleep data</em>: sleep stages and durations (e.g., REM, Deep, Core), sleep sessions.</li>
        <li><em>Vitals</em>: heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate, and related metrics you authorize.</li>
        <li><em>Health Records</em> (if available on your device and you authorize access): used only to compute relevant summaries for you in-app; we do not store raw documents or share them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to display insights, calculate progress toward quests/challenges, and improve your personal sleep trends. We do not use HealthKit data for advertising, data brokerage, or profiling beyond wellness features.</p>

      <h3>2.2 Account &amp; Authentication (via CloudKit)</h3>
      <p>We use <strong>CloudKit</strong> for sign-in with your Apple ID and to store your app data in your private iCloud database. We do not receive your Apple ID password. Apple acts as an identity provider.</p>

      <h3>2.3 Profile &amp; Social Data (stored in CloudKit)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Profile</em>: username, display name, avatar (optional).</li>
        <li><em>Gameplay</em>: user score, streaks, achievements, challenge membership, and progress.</li>
        <li><em>Leaderboards/Rooms</em>: challenge name, room code, participants’ usernames and scores visible to members.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> to enable core features such as rooms, leaderboards, and syncing your progress across devices.</p>

      <h3>2.4 App Usage &amp; Diagnostics</h3>
      <p>With your consent, we may collect minimal, privacy-preserving diagnostics (e.g., crash logs) to improve stability. These may be provided by Apple’s services (e.g., App Analytics). You can manage sharing in iOS Settings &gt; Privacy.</p>

      <h2>3) How We Process Your Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On‑device first:</strong> computations happen on your device where possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud storage:</strong> profile and challenge data are stored in your iCloud (CloudKit). Health data is read when needed and not exported to third‑party servers.</li>
        <li><strong>No ads, no sale of data.</strong> We do not rent or sell personal data. We do not use HealthKit data for marketing or advertising.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Permissions &amp; Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Health permissions:</strong> granted/managed in Apple’s Health app. You can revoke access at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> optional; used for gentle reminders about quests/challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Visibility settings:</strong> in leaderboards/rooms, your username and score are visible to members. You can leave a challenge at any time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You may delete your account from within the app or by contacting us. We will remove your CloudKit records (profile, score, challenge participation).</li>
        <li>Deleting your account <strong>does not delete</strong> any data stored in Apple Health; manage Health data directly in the Health app.</li>
        <li>Backups retained by Apple as part of iCloud may persist for a limited period per Apple’s policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Transport security via HTTPS/TLS.</li>
        <li>CloudKit provides encryption in transit and at rest; access is limited to your iCloud container.</li>
        <li>Local access protected by your device’s passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7) Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>DreamRank is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

      <h2>8) International Transfers</h2>
      <p>CloudKit and iCloud are operated by Apple. Data location and transfer are subject to Apple’s infrastructure and your iCloud account region.</p>

      <h2>9) Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> HealthKit data access and processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Contract:</strong> to provide the app’s core features you request (authentication, syncing, leaderboards).</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to secure, maintain, and improve the app (e.g., fraud prevention, diagnostics).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>10) Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete your data, and to withdraw consent. Use in‑app controls where available or contact us.</p>

      <h2>11) Third‑Party Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not share personal data with third parties except:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>with your <strong>explicit direction</strong> (e.g., sharing to a room/leaderboard you join),</li>
        <li>with service providers acting on our behalf under contract (if any, with no right to use data beyond our instructions), or</li>
        <li>to comply with legal obligations or protect safety, rights, or property.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>12) Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the revised version in‑app and update the effective date above.</p>
